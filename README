 ____ ____   Go-Bits: Trivial bits of Go that don't deserve their own repos

||__|||__||  Some of this code is better documented then the rest, some of it has 
|/__\|/__\|  little todos sprinkled through it and other bits have unfixed bugs

 Keep Calm   Rather then let this code sit idle on my disk I've decided to put it online
  Hack On    in hopes that someone might learn from it. A lot of it is non-idomatic Go as
   Germ      well.
